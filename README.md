# "Sorta" Pebble watchface

Sorta is a fuzzy time watchface (e.g., it shows "A little after eight
fifteen in the evening in early March").  However, it shows fuzzy time
slightly different than others.  I hope you enjoy it.

Also, if you shake the watch, you'll see the exact time / date.  Just
in case you need that.

Finally, the battery percentage will appear in the top right if your
battery is around 30% or less (or if you have it plugged in, so you
can tell when it's fully charged).

Enjoy!
