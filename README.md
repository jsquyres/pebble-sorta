# "Sorta" Pebble watchface

Sorta is a fuzzy time watchface.  However, it shows fuzzy time
slightly different than others.  Here's some examples:

Also, if you shake the watch, you'll see the exact time / date for a
short time.  Just in case you need that.

...but you can use the settings page in the Pebble app on your mobile
device to disable this shake-to-exact behavior, if you wish.

Finally, the battery percentage will appear in the top right if your
battery is around 30% or less (or if you have it plugged in, so you
can tell when it's fully charged).

# Why?

This app is pretty useless.  :-)

It's mainly a vehicle for me to explore different aspects of the
Pebble OS, such as:

* Basic watchface functionality
* Fonts
* Tick timer events
* Wakeup timer events
* Simple bitmap manipulation
* Static storage
* AppMessage interactions
* Configuration window / interaction with JavaScript

Enjoy!
